// In-plugin offline harvester: collects X-Codex-Turn-State straight from the
// upstream, without routing through CPA or touching any CPA state.
//
// # Why direct, and why that is safe
//
// The earlier design harvested by driving CPA: it disabled every Codex account
// but one (so a harvest on CPA's own response hook could be attributed), PATCHed
// a proxy into the credential, POSTed to CPA's /v1/responses, and restored all
// of that afterwards. It cost a real incident when a run died mid-flip and left
// credentials disabled, and it could never run alongside business traffic.
//
// This harvester instead reads each account's own access_token out of its
// credential file (a read-only management call, never a write) and calls
// https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses directly, as that account,
// through that account's own exit. CPA never sees the request. Because we hold
// the token, the harvest is attributed with certainty -- no sole-enablement, so
// every account stays enabled and every account × model can fire in parallel.
//
// Three rules make it safe to run against live credentials:
//   - It never writes anything to CPA. The only CPA calls are two GETs:
//     auth-files (the account list) and auth-files/download (one token).
//   - It never refreshes a token. An expired token is skipped and left for CPA
//     to refresh in its own business; refreshing here could rotate the refresh
//     token and break live traffic. (Access tokens were measured good for days,
//     so this costs almost nothing.)
//   - Substitution and harvest now coexist in one process: the business role
//     reads the store on the request hook while this goroutine fills it.
//
// # Renewal
//
// A harvested token lives ~3600s. The run does not stop after the first fill: it
// keeps a background loop that tops up any in-scope bucket once it drops under a
// few minutes of life left, so the store stays warm for as long as CPA serves
// traffic. That is the operator's "最後5分鐘再獲取一遍".
//
// # What must never leak out of this file
//
// probeRunState.Lines is rendered on a page that needs no key. No token,
// turn-state value, or proxy userinfo may reach it: proxies render through
// probeShowProxy/maskProxyURL, account names through maskAuthLabel (they carry
// a customer email), and everything bound for Lines passes probeRedact as a
// second line of defence. The management key this file reads is never logged.

	// cooldown is built on. There, one URL is one IP, a 312 means that IP is
	// throttled, and re-dialing it inside the window is pointless -- so one
