// Management API for the codex-turn-state plugin.
//
// This plugin is deployed keyless by the operator's explicit, repeated choice:
// opening the dashboard and every action on it work with no management key. The
// box binds CPA to 127.0.0.1 and is reachable only through an SSH tunnel, so
// "keyless" means "anyone who can reach the tunnel", which in practice is the
// operator. That decision is what shapes the two route kinds below.
//
//   - Everything the dashboard uses -- the HTML shell, the status document, and
//     every action it offers (dry_run, role, clear, selftest, scope save, probe
//     start and probe cancel) -- is a ResourceRoute.
//     Those are served under /v0/resource/plugins/<id>/ and the host does NOT
//     authenticate them ("Resource requests are not management-authenticated" --
//     pluginapi). The host also hard-restricts them to GET (ServeResourceHTTP
//     rejects any other method) and passes the query string but no body, so the
//     action routes read their parameters from the query and guard against an
//     accidental firing with confirm=1 rather than with a key.
//
//   - The same clear and selftest operations are ALSO exposed as authenticated
//     ManagementRoutes under /v0/management/ (POST, reading a JSON body), for a
//     script that holds the management key. Those are not what the dashboard
//     calls; they are the keyed API path kept alongside the keyless one. Their
//     Menu field is left empty: a GET route that declares one is re-registered
//     under the resource prefix (routeDeclaresLegacyMenuResource in the host),
//     which would matter only for a GET, but the rule is kept in view here.
//
// No response from any route in this file contains a template value. The store
// holds credential-adjacent secrets; the dashboard needs readiness and expiry,
// and readiness and expiry are all it gets. The status document does expose each
// bucket's auth_id, which is the credential filename and contains the customer
// email -- an accepted consequence of an anonymously readable status.
