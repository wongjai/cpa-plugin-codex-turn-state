// proxy_check.go -- "can this exit reach OpenAI?", answered for the whole pool
// at once.
//
// # Why this exists
//
// The probe walks probe_proxies in order and gives up on an exit that fails,
// which is the right behaviour during a run but a terrible diagnostic: a pool
// where half the exits are dead still harvests, just slower and with fewer
// chances per bucket, and nothing on the page says so. This route answers the
// question directly, for every exit, without waiting for a probe run.
//
// # Why it costs no quota
//
// The reachability request carries NO Authorization and NO Chatgpt-Account-Id.
// An unauthenticated POST to the codex endpoint is answered 401 by OpenAI --
// measured, not assumed -- and a 401 is the success case here: it proves the
// request travelled through the exit, terminated TLS at OpenAI's edge, and was
// answered by the API rather than by the proxy, a captive portal or an
// interception box. No credential is touched, so a run is safe while business
// traffic and a probe are both live, and it cannot be the thing that trips a
// rate limit on an account.
//
// # Why the trace request is on chatgpt.com and not a third-party service
//
// Cloudflare's /cdn-cgi/trace on the same host reports the address the upstream
// actually sees, plus its country and edge datacenter. Asking ipinfo.io instead
// would add a dependency, and would report the exit for a request to ipinfo.io
// -- not necessarily the one OpenAI sees. It is best-effort: the verdict belongs
// to the API request alone, so a trace failure costs the address, never the
// answer.
//
// # What must never leak out of this file
//
// The results render on a page that needs no key, so every proxy goes out
// through probeShowProxy (userinfo replaced wholesale) and every error string
// through probeRedact. The exit address IS reported in the clear: it is strictly
// less sensitive than the proxy URL the status document already serves in the
// clear at the operator's instruction, and seeing it is the whole point -- a
// pool of twenty credentials on one gateway that resolves to three addresses is
// three exits wearing twenty hats, which nothing else on this page would reveal.
